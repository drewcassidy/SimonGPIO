SimonGPIO
=========

SimonGPIO is a version of simon for the raspberry Pi's GPIO, circuit diagrams coming soon!

wired up to the pi for the game is 4 buttons and 4 LEDs, one of each in the colors reg, green, blue, and yellow.
the pi plays an incresingly complicated pattern on the leds, which must be mimicked by the user. if the user gets one wrong, 
the game is over and can be restarted.
